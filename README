How To Compile
==============

```
1. You need msys2
2. You need to install packages from DEPENDENCIES file (install 
autotools too)
2.5. Make sure all toolchain in PATH
3. run ./autogen.sh
4. run ./configure --prefix=<prefix> --shared=<prefix> 
--enable-debug-log
5. run make LDFLAGS="-no-undefined"
6. run make install
7. libfprint-0.dll, libfprint.a, libfprint.dll.a should be in the prefix 
dir
```

Dislaimer
=========

Libfprint is not my project. 
Respective credits should go to the project owners.

I just forked it and made some tweaks so it 
compiles on MSYS2 (MINGW) on Windows. I need it for my project.
